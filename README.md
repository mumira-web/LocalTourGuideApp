# 🌍 Travelink  
**Tagline:** “Explore Smarter, Travel Better.”

---

## 🧭 Project Description  
**Travelink** is a smart and reliable travel companion app designed to help users plan and explore destinations with ease.  
It integrates essential travel information—such as destinations, restaurants, hotels, navigation, and offline access—into one simple mobile app.  
The goal is to make trip planning more efficient, enjoyable, and safe, especially for local travelers and tourists in areas with limited internet connectivity.

## 🚀 Problem Statement  
Travelers often struggle to find reliable, updated information about destinations, accommodations, and nearby attractions.  
Information is scattered across multiple platforms, leading to confusion, wasted time, and safety risks.  
**Travelink** solves this by providing verified, localized data and tools for navigation, discovery, and offline access — all in one app.

## 💡 Proposed Solution  
Travelink centralizes all travel tools into a single Android application that:  
- Provides verified and up-to-date travel information  
- Combines maps, trip planners, and translation tools  
- Works even without an internet connection  
- Suggests authentic local attractions and hidden gems

## ⚙️ Core Features (MVP)  
- **User Registration and Login** – Secure authentication with email and password.  
- **Destination Explorer** – View cities, landmarks, hotels, and restaurants with images.  
- **Nearby Recommendations** – GPS-based display of nearby attractions.  
- **Navigation Assistance** – Real-time Google Maps directions.
